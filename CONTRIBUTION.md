## Contribution

Goomento use the fork and pull model to contribute to the **Project Goomento**. 
This method allows contributors to maintain their own copy of the forked codebase, 
which can be easily synced with the main copy. 
The forked repository is then used to submit a pull request to the base repository to merge a set of changes from the fork into the main repository
